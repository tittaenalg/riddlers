# Solution to The Riddler 167 (April 5, 2019)

Run `freeDrinks.py` to simulate random card use

- Use the first command line argument to specify the number of simulations to run
- Simulations results will output to `output.txt` for further analysis
- Odds of drinks remaining on other card and average drinks on other card will print to the terminal

Excel file shows a distribution graph of simulations, and recalculations of result stats
