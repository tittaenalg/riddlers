# Solution to The Riddler 168 (April 12, 2019)

Run `transitiveChampions.py` to determine the number of transitive winners against any team in the men's or women's season

- Use the first command line argument to specify mens or womens results
- Use the second command line argument to specify the team to check for transitive champions against

For men's Virginia, results are:

- Total teams: 648
- Transitive Champion Teams: 359
- Not Transitive National Champion Teams: 289

For women's Baylor, results are:

- Total teams: 2019
- Transitive National Champion Teams: 1775
- Not Transitive National Champion Teams: 244

Not sure why there are so many more women's teams

The final few lines of code can be uncommented to list out the transitive and/or non transitive winning teams
